# Human-in-the-Loop Graph with Persistent State

A lightweight Python project designed to implement human-in-the-loop techniques using **LangGraph**, maintaining a persistent state across nodes without any involvement from large language models (LLMs). This project is ideal for applications that require human oversight, real-time decision-making, or data processing without AI intervention.

## Features

- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Every node and process involves human interaction, ensuring oversight and control.
- **Persistent State**: The graph retains state across nodes, supporting consistent data management and progress tracking.
- **No LLM Dependency**: Built without large language model integrations, focusing purely on LangGraphâ€™s capabilities.
- **Modular Design**: Each node can be modified, added, or removed independently for flexible workflows.
