# graph-with-human-in-the-loop-memory
A lightweight, human-in-the-loop graph system built with LangGraph, designed to maintain a persistent state across nodes without any reliance on large language models (LLMs). This project enables real-time, interactive workflows with human oversight at each stage, ensuring precision and control without automated AI intervention.
